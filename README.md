Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm Michele Adduci, a Computer Engineer with a passion for embedded systems, Computer Vision and security.

Here on GitHub I maintain a list of Docker Images, especially for C++ oriented projects, mostly to speedup the development and the integration with CI/CD Systems, plus some small projects to get acquainted with a particular language or framework.

My main programming languages are C++, Java and PHP.

You can find more information about me on my personal site at https://madduci.netlify.app
