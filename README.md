Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm Michele Adduci, a Computer Engineer with a passion for embedded systems, Computer Vision and Security.

I focus mainly on Software Engineering, with the ability to work across heterogeneous systems and different programming languages, mainly C++, Java and PHP.

Here on GitHub I keep some of my side-projects, such as some Docker Images, used to speedup the development and the integration with CI/CD Systems and being productive without installing a lot of software directly on my personal computers, plus some small projects to get acquainted with a particular language or framework.

You can find more information about me on my personal site at https://madduci.netlify.app
